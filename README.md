# Computational-Methods-for-Data-Driven-Modelling
I studied the course Computational Methods for Data-Driven Modelling from October 2019 to December 2019. These are the two assignments I have done to accomplish this course.

In Assignment 1, I implemented and compared the method of gradient descent and Nestorov method in (regularised) minimisation problem. It also inculdes some theoretical questions in minimisation problem.

In Assignment 2, the first question is about Comparing RWM (Random Walk Metropolis Algorithm) and MALA (Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm) for a simple Gaussian model. The second part of this assignment is about Image inpaiting by sparse regularisation.
